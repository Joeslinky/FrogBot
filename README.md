# FrogBot
This has become a colabrative effor between a few of us to create the best bot we possibly can. The bot is still in a very rough state as it is. Things are constently breaking as it is.

So far features include:
- Automatic role assignment based on points
- Points assignment and removal
- Points tracking
- Add points via reactions
- Respond to different message
- Updating via commands
- AI LLM intergration via Google Gemini-pro(-vision) with OpenAi Chat-GPT 3.5 Turbo as a fall back.
- Image reginition via Gemini-pro-vision.
- Reply context chain for the LLM, you simply reply to the bots message to continue the chain.
- Very basic and very rough websearch

Things planned:
- Permanent Score board
- AI based filter to determin if a user needs assistance or not.
- Using websearch as context for responses for more accurate responeses.
- Using a non-finetune method for the LLM to pull more relevent info for OpenPilot/FrogPilot.
