**FrogBot** is a collaborative effort among a few of us to create the best bot possible. Please note that the bot is still in a very rough state, and things are constantly breaking.

## Branches
- **Beta:** This is the most updated branch and is constantly being updated and may break.
- **Dev:** A go-to point for PRs and other contributions, it's the more stable of the newer branches but not immune to breaking.
- **Old:** This is the first revision of the bot; there are a few broken things with it, and we wouldn't recommend using it.

*Note: Dev is considered the starting point for most people, as it's primarily for PRs, and we aim to keep it stable.*
